hopeless, i am the denial that you are hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching it is end but you refuse to believe that it is over, here we go all over again backs to the wall, i am stacking up all them odds toilets clogged, yeah, cause i am talking a lot of shit but i am backing it all up but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished, i am your lack of a conscience i am the ringing in your ears i am the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i am your time thats almost up that you have not acknowledged grab for some water but i am that pill thats too jagged to swallow i am the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya, every woman you insult batter, but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers, the rappers persona is half a facade, and matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til it is gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them i am the hindsight to say, i told you so  foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i am the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow if you do not stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cannot call it quits when it is time to walk away, i am every guilt trip the baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions if theres anything you have left to say less it makes an impact, then do not bother so fore you rest your case better make sure you are packing a wallop so, one last time, i am back fore it fades into black and it is all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice, the magic that started it all, tragic portrait of an artist tortured, trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker

brain and thoughts are entertainin but docile and impossible to explain and, i am also vain and probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting puke skywalker, but sound like chewbacca when i talk full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog cannot even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh, it is on the ram page could not see what i wrote, i write small it says, ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with whitewalls had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard. so as long as i am on the clock, punching this time card hip hop aint dying on my watch <endverse>

show you what you need to live <endchorus> <startverse> no, if he had he would not have ended up in these rhymes on my pad i would not be so mad, my attitude would not be so bad yeah, dad, i am the epitome and the prime example of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and makes you want to get up and start dancin even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rappin, blue lights flashin laughin all the way to the bank, lampin in my k mart mansion i am in the style department with a pile in my cart, rippin the aisle apart but with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beat killing spree, your honor i must plead guilty, cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it but several rebuked it, and whoever produced it hip hop is the devils music does that mean it belongs to me cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns that do not honk but every time i speak you hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep, not even a whisper rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it is the <endverse> <startchorus> it is the time of the season when hate runs high and this time, i will not give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone, that is my plan my job here is not done cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing whats your name shady whos your daddy i do not give a fuck, but i wonder is

get one block without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault maybe thats why i am so bananas i a ppealed to all those walks of life, whoever had strife maybe thats what dad and son talks are like cause i related to the struggles of young america when their fucking parents we are unaware of their troubles now they are rippin out their fuckin hair again, it is hysterical i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles yeah, uh oh, better beware, knuckle heads the sign of my hustle says do not knock, the doors broken, it will not lock it might just fly open, get cold cocked you critics come to pay me a visit misery loves company, please stay a minute kryptonite to a hypocrite zip your lip if you dish it but cannot take it too busy gettin stoned in your glass house to kick rocks, then you wonder why i lash out mr. mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word cause i am promoting my passion until i am passed out completely brain dead rain man doing a bankhead in a restraint chair so, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare or get shanked in the pancreas i am angrier than all eight other reindeer put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thang, yeah even this rhyme, bitch and quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there but i still am a criminal ten year old degenerate grabbin on my genitals the last mathers lp done went diamond this time i am predicting this one will go emerald when will the madness end how can it when theres no method to the pad and pen the only message that i have to send is dad, i am

surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals and i feel like i am more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin neighbors but see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave but why does it seem like i am not even put up in the same category as other mcs so when weezy says that he is better than jay z please be that just subliminally means he thinks jiggas the best and that he is the only one up in that league, see and it is easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowin goddamn well that i am one of the best motherfuckin rappers who ever lived, period i am a g.o.a.t. and i do not mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazinesll never put it in ink

ever do hear anyone even bringin up that paul walls white cause lyrically he does not pose a threat to anyone, see, he is just aight and bubba sparxxx, he just will not write because he is so caught up in that snow white that timbaland cannot even get him in the studio he is so gone off that coke, right and it is so sad cause he is dope, right americas next great white hope, right so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right and which i am still havin mixed feelings about they said itd be real, i am just spillin it out theres somethin about a white boy talkin black and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth and i love when the say that tiger woods shit is not it ironic that the best rappers white and the best golfers black and i am the one whos gotta catch all the flack off of that but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out but i had already hit middle america parents had all got to likin me now
