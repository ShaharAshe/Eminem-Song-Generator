# Nlp final project

Eminem song generator

first we need an eminem dataset /(huggin face has one)
we need to pre proccess the data
than we will feed it to our choice of network (prob Bi-LSTM)
we will generte some examples...

than we want to train gpt2 or gpt 3.5 or another model(t5 robrta etc..) with the same dataset of eminem lyrics
and also generate the results 

than we want to compare them both.

we have to compare the manually, for checks like:
Our manual checks: 
1. writing style
2. proper wording
3. rhyming
4. length
5. logical continueation
   
than we can also send the output
to the chatGPT api 3.5 , and ask him if 
he thinks its a eminem song or if its similar, to any songs he knows.

we can also add more models and compare them all
