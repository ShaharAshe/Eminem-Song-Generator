# NLP Final Project: Eminem Song Generator

## Overview
This project is an exploration into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and neural networks, specifically focusing on generating song lyrics in the style of the iconic rapper Eminem. The project compares different models, all trained on a dataset of Eminem's lyrics, to find the most effective approach in capturing the unique style and essence of his music.

## Files Description
1. `FinalProject.ipynb`: Main project notebook that outlines the project's objectives, methodology, and findings.
2. `Gpt2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the process of training a GPT-2 model for Eminem song lyrics generation. This includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. `utilities.py`: Python utility script containing helper functions for data manipulation, model training, and other supportive tasks.

## Setup and Installation
- Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed.
- Install required Python packages: `pandas`, `re`, and others as specified in the notebooks.
- Clone the project repository to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Begin with the `FinalProject.ipynb` notebook to understand the project scope and methodology.
2. Use `Gpt2.ipynb` to train the GPT-2 model and generate Eminem-style song lyrics.
3. The `utilities.py` script is imported and used within the notebooks for various utility functions.
